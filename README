You need the following installed
    Desktopmagic
    pywin32
    ffmpeg-python
    ffmpeg (MUST BE IN THE FOLDER OR IN PATH)


*TODO*
* Run ffmpeg to append each new image to video, to reduce the amount of space used
    - Will this mean I don't have to check for previous image..dependent on interval
* Create unique recording names (Date and time started maybe)
* Add interface to start and stop recordings
    - Add interval
    - Storage location
    - Maybe some quality settings for ffmpeg


Run this on the folder at the end of the day 
& 'C:\Program Files\ffmpeg\bin\ffmpeg.exe' -framerate 10 -r 3 -start_number 1 -i %d.jpg -vcodec mpeg4 output.mp4
